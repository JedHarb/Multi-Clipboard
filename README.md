# Multi-Clipboard
When you want lots of different text ready to paste. (Press Ctrl + 9 to launch or reload.)

Click the buttons or use the corresponding hotkeys to paste any text back into your program.

The program will create, save to, and read from the .ini file in the same location as the script. If you move your script, move the .ini file with it.

### Disclaimers and Environment
This was designed and working in Windows 10 with AHK v1.1. I'll have to try it on Windows 11 and AHK V2 someday when I have it, but I assume almost all items here will work the same.

This is created with AutoHotKey, which is a safe program, but Windows often doesn't like it. You are safe to run this .exe, but if you still have any security concerns (or if Windows keeps deleting it), you can download AHK 1.1 from https://www.autohotkey.com/ to run the .ahk file directly or compile it into your own .exe instead.
